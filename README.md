Senergy is a open-source, recursive DNS server written in C++. Senergy intends to be light DNS server, mostly for learning purposes. Senergy is developed on Linux (Xubuntu 14.04 x64) but could be (with a little work) compiled on other platforms such as Windows or Mac OS X. Senergy uses Git for source version control (Github), Doxygen for documentation, GCC (4.7) as compiler, GDB as debugger and Valgrind as memory leak scanner. Another important aspect of Senergy is that it intends to use as little external libraries as possible.

For for more information on building and running Senergy, see the 'Building' page.

Currently Senergy is under initial development.
