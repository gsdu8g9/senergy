The following is required to to build \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy}\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian based operating system
\item G\-C\-C 4.\-7
\item G\-N\-U Make
\item Git
\item G\-Flags
\item Snappy
\item Zlib
\item Bzip2
\item Rocks\-D\-B
\end{DoxyItemize}

All external libraries are for Rocks\-D\-B, you can download and install them all at once\-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-\textcolor{keyword}{get} install libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev
\end{DoxyCode}


When you have setup all required libraries and tools, you can clone the source code repository using Git\-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone https:\textcolor{comment}{//github.com/Photonios/senergy.git}
\end{DoxyCode}


You should now have the \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} source code. Change into the cloned directory\-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
cd senergy
\end{DoxyCode}


And build the project\-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
make
\end{DoxyCode}


The Rocks\-D\-B library is added as a Git submodule and will be build when you build \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy}. After compiling and linking finishes, you should have the executable in the 'bin' directory.
