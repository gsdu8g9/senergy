\hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} is a open-\/source, recursive D\-N\-S server written in C++. \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} is currently being written for a graduation project, but intends to be light D\-N\-S server, mostly for learning purposes. \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} is developed on Linux (Xubuntu 14.\-04 x64) but could be (with a little work) compiled on other platforms such as Windows or Mac O\-S X. \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} uses Git for source version control (Github), Doxygen for documentation, G\-C\-C (4.\-7) as compiler, G\-D\-B as debugger and Valgrind as memory leak scanner. Another important aspect of \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} is that it intends to use as little external libraries as possible.

For for more information on building and running \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy}, see the 'Building' page.

Currently \hyperlink{namespace_senergy}{Senergy} is under initial development. When version 1.\-0 is finished new goals will be set. The current goals, requirements and definition of done can be found in the project proposal document (see Documents page).
