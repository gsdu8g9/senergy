Another important aspect of <ref refid="namespace_senergy" kindref="compound">Senergy</ref> is that it intends to use as little external libraries as possible.</para><para>For for more information on building and running <ref refid="namespace_senergy" kindref="compound">Senergy</ref>, see the &apos;Building&apos; page.</para><para>Currently <ref refid="namespace_senergy" kindref="compound">Senergy</ref> is under initial development. When version 1.0 is finished new goals will be set. The current goals, requirements and definition of done can be found in the project proposal document (see Documents page). </para>    </detaileddescription>
