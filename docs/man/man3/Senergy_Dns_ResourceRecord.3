.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Defines a DNS Resource Record, as defined in RFC 1035, section 4\&.1\&.3\&. A DNS Recource record can appear both in the answer, authority and additional section of a DNS packet/message\&. 

All fields in a resource record are the same, regardless of whether it is an answer, authority or additional record\&. The only difference is the format of the last field, the resource data field\&. The format of this field depends on the resource record type\&. 
.PP
.nf
This class does NOT implement the resource data field, and does not serialize/deserilize it.

.fi
.PP
 Instead, new classes should be created per resource record type, which do implement the resource data field, and need an instance of this class to serialize/deserialize\&.

.SS "bool Senergy::Dns::ResourceRecord::Deserialize (\fBByteBuffer\fP &buffer)"

.PP
Deserializes a resource record from the specified buffer into this instance\&. The specified buffer must have at least 4 bytes left to read\&. However, the size of a resource record is variable, because of the name field\&.
.PP
When we can not read the entire resource record from the specified buffer, false is returned\&.
